# Λnk Dokka Plugin

_Compile time docs verification and evaluation for Kotlin._

_Λnk_ short for [Ankhesenpaaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankhesenamun) wife and sister of [Tutankhamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun), is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin to verify code snippets in library docs for the Kotlin and Java programming languages.

Λnk is inspired by the awesome docs and tutorial generator for Scala [`tut`](http://tpolecat.github.io/tut/).

Λnk is a very simple documentation tool for Kotlin and Java written using [Λrrow](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow) that reads Markdown files and interprets and evaluates Kotlin and Java code in `ank` sheds, allowing you to write documentation that is typechecked and run as part of your build.
In a nutshell, Λnk works evaluating, then capturing results and including them after the expressions so they can be read in the documentation. The point of Λnk is to provide code that the user can type in and expect to work.

## Basic setup

TODO()

## Run Λnk

```
./gradlew :module-name:dokkaHtml
```

This will process all Kotlin & Java snippets inside KDoc, while providing all runtime dependencies (`sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath`) in the `classpath`.

## Errors output

When something goes wrong Λnk shows what snippet has failed and where, including the compiler errors.

For example, if some `import`s are missing:

````
```kotlin:ank
val someValue: Option<String> = Some("I am wrapped in something")
someValue
```
````

Λnk will report the following:

````

## Modifiers

By default Λnk compiles and evaluates the snippets of code included in `<language>:ank` sheds. However sometimes you might want a definition without printing the result out, or might want to replace an entire snippet with the output of the resulting evaluation. For these occasions Λnk provides a number of modifiers that you can add to the shed declaration i.e. `<language>:ank:*`.
The language used (Kotlin or Java) should be prepended to `:ank` e.g. `kotlin:ank:replace`. The following modifiers are supported.

| Modifier | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `:silent` | Suppresses output; under this modifier the input and output text are identical. |
| `:replace` | Replaces an entire snippet with the output of the resulting evaluation. |
| `:fail` | The error raised from the code snippet will be appended at the end. |

### `<language>:ank`

Kotlin example:

````
```kotlin:ank
import arrow.*
import arrow.core.*

val someValue: Option<String> = Some("I am wrapped in something")
someValue
```
````

Output:

````
```kotlin
import arrow.*
import arrow.core.*

val someValue: Option<String> = Some("I am wrapped in something")
someValue
// Some(I am wrapped in something)
```
````

### `:silent`

Example:

````
```kotlin:ank:silent
fun maybeItWillReturnSomething(flag: Boolean): Option<String> =
   if (flag) Some("Found value") else None
val itWillReturn = maybeItWillReturnSomething(true)
itWillReturn
```
````

Output:

````
```kotlin
fun maybeItWillReturnSomething(flag: Boolean): Option<String> =
   if (flag) Some("Found value") else None
val itWillReturn = maybeItWillReturnSomething(true)
itWillReturn
```
````

### `:replace`

Example:

````
```kotlin:ank:replace
fun hello(name: String) = "Hello $name!"

hello("Λrrow")
```
````

That snippet will be replaced by "Hello Arrow!" after running `runAnk`.
